Position:  8th   7th   6th   5th   4th   3rd   2nd   1st
           128   64    32    16    8     4     2     1
           
           
           200 =11001000
           
           255 =11111111
           
           So each space you move to from left to right, youâ€™re doubling the number.

i.e. = 128-64-32-16-8-4-2-1
